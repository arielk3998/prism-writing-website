git push -u origin master
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Repository
```bash
# If repository exists but has different name/location:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CORRECT_USERNAME/CORRECT_REPO_NAME.git

```

### Option 3: Force Push (if repository exists but diverged)
```bash
# If you need to overwrite remote with local changes:
git push --force origin master
```
