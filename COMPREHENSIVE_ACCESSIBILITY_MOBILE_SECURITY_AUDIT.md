```typescript
// src/hooks/useDeviceDetection.ts
export const useDeviceDetection = () => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)')
  const isTablet = useMediaQuery('(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px)')
  const isDesktop = useMediaQuery('(min-width: 1025px)')
  const isTouchDevice = useMediaQuery('(pointer: coarse)')
  
  return { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop, isTouchDevice }
}
```

#### **1.2 Automatic Mobile Optimizations**
- Adaptive component rendering based on device type

```typescript
// Enhanced role-based access control
export const enforceWorkspaceAccess = (user: User, workspace: string) => {
  if (!user.allowedWorkspaces.includes(workspace)) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('Access denied to workspace')
  }
}
```

#### **3.2 Enhanced Authentication Middleware**
- Route-level permission enforcement
