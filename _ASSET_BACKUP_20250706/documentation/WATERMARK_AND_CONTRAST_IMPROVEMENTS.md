# Watermark and Contrast Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to address watermark visibility, text contrast issues, and dark mode functionality across the Prism Writing website.

## üî¥ Watermark Improvements

### Problem
- Watermarks were too light (0.08 opacity) and purple-colored
- Difficult to see, making unauthorized use more likely
- Needed to be more prominent to discourage misuse

### Solution
- **Color Changed**: From purple `rgba(111, 66, 193, 0.08)` to red `rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.6)`
- **Opacity Increased**: From 0.08 to 0.6 (7.5x more visible)
- **Enhanced Styling**: Added text shadow and letter spacing for better visibility
- **Applied Globally**: Updated all 16 sample HTML files automatically

### Technical Implementation
```css
.watermark {
    color: rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.6);           /* Bright red color */
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Text shadow for depth */
    letter-spacing: 8px;                      /* Increased spacing */
}
```

### Files Updated
- `/public/samples/hipaa-compliance-sample.html`
- `/public/samples/pci-dss-compliance-sample.html`
- `/public/samples/fda-21cfr11-validation-sample.html`
- `/public/samples/sox-compliance-sample.html`
- And 12 additional sample files...

## üí° Text Contrast Improvements

### Problem
- Light mode text was difficult to read on certain backgrounds
- Custom contrast classes had insufficient contrast ratios
- Poor accessibility compliance

### Solution
- **Improved Contrast Classes**: Enhanced `.text-muted-contrast` from 35% to 25% lightness
- **Better Dark Mode Colors**: Improved dark mode contrast from 75% to 80% lightness
- **WCAG Compliance**: Ensures better accessibility standards

### Technical Implementation
```css
.text-muted-contrast {
    color: hsl(215.4, 16.3%, 25%);  /* Darker for better contrast */
}

.dark .text-muted-contrast {
    color: hsl(215, 20.2%, 80%);   /* Lighter in dark mode */
}
```

## üåì Dark Mode Toggle Additions

### Problem
- Services page missing dark mode toggle
- Inconsistent dark mode support across pages

### Solution
- **Added Dark Mode Toggle**: Services page now includes `DarkModeToggle` component
- **Enhanced Dark Mode Support**: Added `dark:` variants throughout services page
- **Consistent Navigation**: All pages now have consistent dark mode functionality

### Files Updated
- `/src/app/services/page.tsx` - Added DarkModeToggle import and usage
- `/src/app/about/page.tsx` - Already had toggle (verified working)

## üé® Color and Background Improvements

### Services Page Enhancements
- **Main Container**: Added `dark:bg-gray-900` for proper dark background
- **Hero Section**: Enhanced gradient with dark mode support
- **Service Cards**: Added dark variants for backgrounds and text
- **Pricing Section**: Enhanced background gradients for both modes

### About Page Enhancements
- **Text Classes**: Improved contrast for all text elements
- **Maintained Functionality**: Existing dark mode toggle confirmed working

## üîß Technical Details

### Automated Updates
Created `update-watermarks.sh` script for batch processing:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Updates all HTML sample files with new watermark styles
find public/samples -name "*.html" -type f | while read file; do
    sed -i 's/color: rgba(111, 66, 193, 0\.08);/color: rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.6);...
done
```
