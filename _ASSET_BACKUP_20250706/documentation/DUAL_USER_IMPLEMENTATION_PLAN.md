# 🏢 **DUAL-USER PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
## Prism Writing: Customer vs Internal Team Portal Strategy

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: TWO DISTINCT USER ECOSYSTEMS**

### **THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE**
Prism Writing currently serves a **dual-user platform** but only has customer-facing functionality deployed. The **internal team has no operational management system**, creating significant workflow, quality control, and scalability bottlenecks.

### **PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS**
```
CUSTOMER PORTAL          vs.          INTERNAL TEAM PORTAL
─────────────────                    ─────────────────────
• Project requests                   • Task assignment & scheduling
• Status tracking                    • Document review workflows
• File exchange                      • Quality control processes
• Billing information               • Team collaboration tools
• Support communication             • Resource management
• Service catalog access            • Performance analytics
                                    • Client account management
                                    • Internal communications
```

## 👥 **USER SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **🎯 CUSTOMER USERS** (External - Limited Access)
**Security Level**: Restricted to their own projects and data
**Primary Functions**: 
- Submit project requests and specifications
- Track progress of their projects
- Exchange files securely with their assigned team
- View and pay invoices
- Communicate with their project manager

### **🏢 INTERNAL TEAM USERS** (Staff - Full Operational Access)
**Security Level**: Access to operational tools, multiple projects, and internal data
**Primary Functions**:
- **Project Managers**: Resource allocation, client oversight, timeline management
- **Translators/Writers**: Work queue, collaboration tools, progress tracking
- **Quality Reviewers**: Document review, approval workflows, quality metrics
- **Account Managers**: Client relationships, billing oversight, business development
- **Administrators**: System management, user roles, analytics, security
