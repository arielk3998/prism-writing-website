- **Color System:** Full color palette with theme variants and semantic colors
- **Spacing System:** Mathematical progression scale for consistent spacing
- **Component System:** All UI components standardized with design tokens
- **Global Styles:** Completely refactored `app/globals.css` using design tokens

### 2. Page Standardization (100% Complete)
**All 6 pages successfully standardized:**
- ✅ `/` (Home) - Modern layout with hero section
- ✅ `/services` - Full design token integration
- ✅ `/translation-services` - Modern Navigation/Footer
- ✅ `/translation-quote` - Standardized styling
- ✅ `/portfolio` - Updated layout
- ✅ `/resources` - Consistent theming

### 3. Component Architecture (100% Complete)
**Modern Components:**
- ✅ `components/navigation.tsx` - Standardized navigation
- ✅ `components/footer.tsx` - Consistent footer
- ✅ `components/hero-section.tsx` - Design token integration
- ✅ `components/services-showcase.tsx` - Standardized
- ✅ `components/ui/button.tsx` - Complete button system
- ✅ `components/ui/input.tsx` - Form input standardization
- ✅ `components/ui/card.tsx` - Consistent card components
- ✅ `components/dark-mode-toggle.tsx` - Theme switching

**Legacy Components Removed:**
- 🗑️ `components/Layout.tsx` - Removed (replaced with Navigation/Footer)
- 🗑️ `components/MainNavigation.tsx` - Removed (replaced with modern navigation)

### 4. Build & Quality Assurance (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Build Status:** All builds pass successfully
- ✅ **TypeScript:** No type errors
- ✅ **JSX Structure:** All components properly structured
- ✅ **Dependencies:** No legacy dependencies remain
- ✅ **Performance:** Optimized bundle sizes
- ✅ **Static Generation:** All routes generate properly
