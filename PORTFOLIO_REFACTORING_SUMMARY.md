# Portfolio Page Refactoring Summary

## Completed Work

This document summarizes the refactoring work completed on the Prism Writing website's Portfolio page and related pages to ensure consistency with the centralized configuration system.

## Portfolio Page Enhancement

### âœ… Enhanced Portfolio Page (`/src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`)
- **Already using centralized config**: The portfolio page was previously refactored to use components and centralized data
- **Comprehensive content**: Features 9 detailed project samples across different document types
- **Document types section**: Shows supported file formats (DOC, CAD, spreadsheets, media)
- **Professional design**: Consistent with site-wide design system
- **CTA and footer**: Includes call-to-action and footer sections

### âœ… About Page (`/src/app/about/page.tsx`)
- **Using siteConfig**: Already imports and uses `siteConfig.company.shortName`
- **Comprehensive content**: Mission, cooperative model explanation, expertise areas, values
- **Professional structure**: Well-organized sections with consistent styling
- **Centralized company info**: Uses config for company names and descriptions

### âœ… Pricing Page (`/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`)
- **Fully centralized**: Uses `siteConfig.packages` and `siteConfig.services` for all pricing data
- **Dynamic content**: All packages and individual service cards generated from config
- **Consistent pricing display**: Uses centralized formatting functions
- **Complete feature set**: Packages, individual services, pricing factors, process overview

### âœ… Contact Page (`/src/app/contact/page.tsx`)
- **Enhanced and refactored**: Completely rebuilt to use centralized configuration
- **Using siteConfig data**:
  - Company email, phone, business hours
  - Response time and consultation duration
  - Service listings with pricing
  - Industry information
- **Comprehensive content**: Contact methods, services overview, process, industries
- **Professional design**: Consistent with site-wide styling

## Configuration Updates

### âœ… Enhanced SiteConfig (`/src/config/siteConfig.ts`)
- **Added contact information**:
  - `businessHours`: "Mon-Fri, 9AM-6PM EST"

## Next Steps

The core refactoring work is complete. Future enhancements could include:
