## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **KEY COMPONENTS CONNECTED:**

#### **1. Portal Routing System**
```typescript
// Dynamic component rendering based on user role
const renderComponent = () => {
  switch (activeFeature) {
    case 'dashboard': return <Dashboard user={currentUser} />;
    case 'projects': return <ProjectManagement user={currentUser} />;
    case 'files': return <FileManager user={currentUser} />;
    case 'analytics': return <AnalyticsDashboard user={currentUser} />;
    case 'account': return <AccountManagement user={currentUser} />;
  }
};
```

#### **2. User Authentication Mock System**
```typescript
// Production-ready structure for real auth integration
const mockUsers: Record<string, User> = {
  'customer': { role: 'CLIENT', ... },
  'project-manager': { role: 'ADMIN', ... },
  'translator': { role: 'MEMBER', ... },
  // ... additional roles
};
```

#### **3. Feature Access Control**
```typescript
// Role-based feature visibility
const portalFeatures = {
  'CLIENT': [dashboard, files, account],
  'ADMIN': [dashboard, projects, files, analytics, account],
  'MEMBER': [dashboard, projects, files, account],
  // ... role-specific features
};
```
